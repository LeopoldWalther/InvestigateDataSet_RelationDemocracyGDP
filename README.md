# Investigation for correlation in democracy score and GDP Private

This project is part of the Udacity Nanodegree Data Analyst. It is based on data from Gapminder about a variety of countries. Subject of this report is an investigation of a possible correlation in life expectency (male/female) and average income to level of democracy. Does democracy have some kind of direct or indirect effect on life expactency of its inhabitants or income? Can this correlation be proven consistently in all countries, which are part of the database. If there is a correlation, does this correlation apply to males and females equally?
